# Functional programming

[What is functional programming](what-is-functional-programming.md)

[Immutable types](immutable-types.md) and [expressions](expressions.md) over statements.


While immerative types and expressions are important, they alone dont make a language functional.
For a language to be considered functional it must treat functins as first class citizens.
In other words, a function is merely another data type that can be declared and passed aroud like a string, integer or any other data type.
