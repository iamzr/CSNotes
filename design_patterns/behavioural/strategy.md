# Strategy Pattern

## Characteristics
- Context: has a reference to a strategy and invokes it 
- Strategy: a contrete implementation of the strategy
- IStrategy: Defines the interface for the given strategy

KP: We can select an implementation at runtime based on user input without having to extend the class

Whenever you inject an interface to allow change of behaviour you are leveraging the strategy pattern.
